# Programming at University

This repository contains sample solutions and other learning materials for some of my university courses. Of course, over time I have learnt to write cleaner code.

**1. C Programming (1st Semester)**

**2. Avanced C Programming (2nd Semester)**

**3. C++ Object Oriented Programming and STL (2nd Semester)**

**4. Python Programming (Voluntary course with no credits)**


Remarks about university courses:

Unfortunately, my university has been quite a waste of time, energy, and money. I would be happy to discuss my educational experience in detail with anyone who is interested.
