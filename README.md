This repository contains sample solutions and other learning materials for some of my university courses. Of course, over time I have learnt to write cleaner code.

1. C Programming (1st Semester)

2. Avanced C Programming (2nd Semester)

3. C++ Object Oriented Programming and STL (2nd Semester)

3. Python Programming (Voluntary course with no credits)
