# Programming at University

This repository contains sample solutions and other learning materials for some of my university courses. Of course, over time I have learnt to write cleaner code.


* C Programming

* Avanced C Programming

* C++ Object Oriented Programming and STL

* Python (voluntary course with no credits)

* Computer Graphics

* Software Engineering

* Computer Networks

* Computer Vision

Enrolling in a university to study Computer Science was a mere formality.
