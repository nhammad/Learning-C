# Programming at University

This repository contains sample solutions and other learning materials for some of my university courses. Of course, over time I have learnt to write cleaner code.


**C Programming (1st Semester)**

**Avanced C Programming (2nd Semester)**

**C++ Object Oriented Programming and STL (2nd Semester)**

**Python Programming (Voluntary course with no credits)**



Remarks about university courses:

Unfortunately, my university has been quite a waste of time, energy, and money. I would be happy to discuss my educational experience in detail with anyone who is interested.
