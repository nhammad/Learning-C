# Programming at University

This repository contains sample solutions and other learning materials for some of my university courses. Of course, over time I have learnt to write cleaner code.


* C Programming

* Avanced C Programming

* C++ Object Oriented Programming and STL

* Python (voluntary course with no credits)

* Computer Graphics

* Software Engineering


Unfortunately, my university has been quite a waste of time, energy, and money. I would be happy to discuss my educational experience in detail with anyone who is interested.
