# Software Engineering

This repository contains code-bases for the Beer Game I built during my Software Engineering course. In each sprint, we worked on a different code base with a different partner. Sprint 4 has the final version of the game.

**Tech-stack:**

- C++ for backend
- QT for Graphical User Interface
- Google Tests for unit testing
- Doxygen for documentation
- lcov for test coverage
- MySQL for databases
