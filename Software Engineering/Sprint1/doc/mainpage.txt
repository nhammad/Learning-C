 * \subsection intro What's the Game About?
 *
 * The beer game is an online game intended for students to better understand how
* supply chain works in a real world situation. This project
* simulates the way beer is being ordered and delivered from production and factory,
* going to distributor, then wholesaler and then to retailer and consumer. Each of these
* stages can be played by the students who, order enough beer stock in the position they
* hold, taking into consideration shipment times, delays, backorders, inventory such that,
* every partner in this chain doesn’t suffer any losses.
* 
* \subsection info How Does Beer Game Work?
* Beer game is a 4-player game where each player represents one of the four stages of the 
* Beer Supply Chain process: the manufacturer, the distributor, the wholesaler, and the retailer.
* The purpose of this game is to receive beer orders, deliver items back to consumers successfully, 
* maximize profits, and minimize the total cumulative cost   arising   from   all   stages   
based   on   the   limited   information   provided   for   each   role.

Each week, the retailer receives orders of beer from the consumer without any time delay, 
and evaluates the consumer’s demand order. The retailer fulfills as many units of beer order 
as it can and then calculates how many more units are required based on the total number of 
items in the stock, the cost of each item in the stock and the backlog.

After some time delay, an order is placed to the wholesaler. Now, the wholesaler tries to 
fulfill the demand from the retailer and then calculates how much more beer is required. 
For the remaining amount, the wholesaler places an order with the distributor, who repeats 
the same process and places an order with the manufacturer.

Finally, the manufacturer, or the factory, begins the production according to the demand 
order received. After some time when the production is over (for instance, one week), 
the beer is sent backwards to the distributor, from the distributor to the wholesaler, 
then to the retailer, and finally to the consumer. There will be some time delays of delivery 
between each role, except between the retailer and consumer, during   the   downstream   process.
